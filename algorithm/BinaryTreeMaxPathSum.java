 * Given a binary tree, find the maximum path sum. The path may start and
 * end at any node in the tree. For example, given the below binary tree
 *
 *     1
 *    / \
 *   2   3
 * the result is 6.
 * Analysis
 * 1) Recursively solve this problem
 * 2) Get largest left sum and right sum
 * 2) Compare to the stored maximum
