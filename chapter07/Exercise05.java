/**
 * (Print distinct numbers)
 * Write a program that reads in ten numbers and displays
 * the number of distinct numbers and the distinct numbers
 * separated by exactly one space (i.e., if a number appears multiple
 * times, it is displayed only once). (Hint: Read a number and store it
 * to an array if it is new. If the number is already in the array,
 * ignore it.) After the input, the array contains the distinct numbers.
