/**
 * (Physics: finding runway length)
 * Given an airplaneâ€™s acceleration a and take-off speed v,
 * you can compute the minimum runway length needed for an
 * airplane to take off using the following formula:
 *               length = v*v/2a
 * Write a program that prompts the user to enter v in meters/second (m/s)
 * and the acceleration a in meters/second squared (m/s2),
 * and displays the minimum run- way length.
