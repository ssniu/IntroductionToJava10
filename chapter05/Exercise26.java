/**
 * (Compute e) You can approximate e using the following series:
 * e = 1 + 1/1! + 1/2! + ... + 1/i!
 * Write a program that displays the e value for i = 10000, 20000, ... and 100000.
 * Hint: i! = 1/(i (i-1)!).
 * Initialize e and item to be 1 and keep adding a new item to e. the new item is
 * the previouse item divided by i for i = 2,3,4...
