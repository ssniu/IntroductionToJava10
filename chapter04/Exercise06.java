 * (Random points on a circle) Write a program that generates three random points
 * on a circle centered at (0, 0) with radius 40 and display three angles in a triangle
 * formed by these three points, as shown in Figure 4.7a. (Hint: Generate a random
 * angle a in radians between 0 and 2p, as shown in Figure 4.7b and the point determined
 * by this angle is (r*cos(a), r*sin(a)).)
