 * Write a program that repeatedly prompts the user
 * to enter a capital for a state. Upon receiving the user input,
 * the program reports whether the answer is correct.
 * Assume that 50 states and their capitals are stored in a
 * twodimensional array, as shown in Figure 8.10.
 * The program prompts the user to answer all states’ capitals
 * and displays the total correct count. The user’s answer is
 * not case-sensitive.
 * A two-dimensional array stores states and their capitals.
