/**
 * (Points nearest to each other)
 * Listing 8.3 gives a program that finds two points in a
 * two-dimensional space nearest to each other.
 * Revise the program so that it finds two
 * points in a three-dimensional space nearest to each other.
 * Use a two-dimensional array to represent the points.
 * Test the program using the following points:
 *  double[][] points = {{-1, 0, 3}, {-1, -1, -1}, {4, 1, 1},
 *      {2, 0.5, 9}, {3.5, 2, -1}, {3, 1.5, 3}, {-1.5, 4, 2},
 *      {5.5, 4, -0.5}};
 * The formula for computing the distance between two points (x1, y1, z1) and
 * (x2, y2, z2) is ((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 + (z2 - z1)^2)^0.5.
