/**
 * (Displaying the prime factors)
 * Write a program that prompts the user to enter a positive integer and
 * displays all its smallest factors in decreasing order. For
 * example, if the integer is 120, the smallest factors are displayed
 * as 5, 3, 2, 2, 2.
 * Use the StackOfIntegers class to store the
 * factors (e.g., 2, 2, 2, 3, 5) and
 * retrieve and display them in reverse order.
